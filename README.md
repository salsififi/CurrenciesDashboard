# Currencies Dashboard
A project strongly inspired by "Cr√©er un tableau de bord de devises" course 
on [Docstring](https://www.docstring.fr/) website.

## Description
This project displays a dashboard for various currencies, with their rates evolutions.
THE RATES ARE FAKE, randomly genered from Docstring's API, as this is just an exercise 
to include JavaScript in a django project.

## Frameworks and libraries
- django, for backend
- Bootstrap (via CDN) for frontend
- Charts.js (via CDN) for charts
